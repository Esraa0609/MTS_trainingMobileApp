# Sales Representative App - Misr Technology Services

This repository contains the project I developed during my training at Misr Technology Services in the Business Application Integration Development department. The app is designed to help sales representatives streamline their daily tasks, improving efficiency and productivity.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time product availability** and **order placement**
- **Delivery tracking**
- Personalized **sales dashboards** with targets and analytics
- **Multi-language support** for diverse markets
- Clean code structure using separation of concerns for maintainability

Developed with **Figma** for design and **Flutter** for implementation, this app enhances business processes by automating administrative tasks, allowing sales reps to focus on client relationships.
